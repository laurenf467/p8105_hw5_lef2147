Question 1: The code chunk below loads the iris dataset from the
tidyverse package and introduces some missing values in each column. The
purpose of this problem is to fill in those missing values.

There are two cases to address:

  - For numeric variables, you should fill in missing values with the
    mean of non-missing values
  - For character variables, you should fill in missing values with
    “virginica”

Write a function that takes a vector as an argument; replaces missing
values using the rules defined above; and returns the resulting vector.
Apply this function to the columns of iris\_with\_missing using a map
statement.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
function will help Iterate over file names and read in data for each
subject using purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the
dataframe Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm
and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
other tidying that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing
observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences
between groups.

``` r
load_and_tidy = function(path) {
  
  df = list.files(path = path, full.names = TRUE) %>% map_df(read_csv, col_names = TRUE)
  
  names = list.files(path = path) %>% gsub(pattern = ".csv$", replacement = "")
  
  df$names = names

Overall, the experimental group as an upward trend for “value” whereas
the control group does not show a large difference between week 1 and
week 8. All subjects in experimental group increase their value over the
8 weeks.

When designing an experiment or analysis, a common question is whether
it is likely that a true effect will be detected – put differently,
whether a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The probability that a
false null hypothesis is rejected is referred to as power, and it
depends on several factors, including: the sample size; the effect size;
and the error variance. In this problem, you will conduct a simulation
to explore power in a simple linear regression.

First set the following design elements:

  - Fix n=30
  - Fix xi1 as draws from a standard Normal distribution
  - Fix β0=2
  - Fix σ2=50

Set β1=0. Generate 10000 datasets from the model yi=β0+β1xi1+ϵi with
ϵi∼N\[0,σ2\]. For each dataset, save β̂1 and the p-value arising from
a test of H:β1=0 using α=0.05 Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value,
use broom::tidy to clean the output of lm.

Repeat the above for β1={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and complete the following:

``` r
set.seed(1)

regression = function(n = 30, beta0 = 2, beta1) {
  
  data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 50),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, 50)
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = data)
  
  ls_fit  = broom::tidy(ls_fit)

}
```

``` r
sim_results = 
  tibble(
    beta1 = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  ) %>% 
    mutate(
      output_list = map(.x = beta1, ~rerun(10000, regression(beta1 = .x))),
      output_df = map(output_list, bind_rows)
   ) %>% 
   select(-output_list) %>% 
   unnest(output_df) %>% 
  filter(term == "x") %>% 
  select(beta1, estimate, p.value)
```

  - Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected
    (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of β1 on
    the x axis. Describe the association between effect size and power.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
power = sim_results %>% group_by(beta1) %>% 
  filter(p.value <= 0.05) %>% 
  summarise(
    power = n()/10000
  )

power %>% ggplot(aes(x = beta1, y = power)) +
  geom_point() 
```

![](p8105_hw5_lef2147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

As the effect size increases, the power of the test increases.

Make a plot showing the average estimate of β̂1 on the y axis and the
true value of β1 on the x axis.

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of β̂1
only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and the
true value of β1 on the x axis. Is the sample average of β̂1 across
tests for which the null is rejected approximately equal to the true
value of β1? Why or why not?

``` r
sim_results %>% group_by(beta1) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_beta1 = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% ggplot(aes(mean_beta1, beta1)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw5_lef2147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
sim_results %>% filter(p.value >= 0.05) %>% group_by(beta1) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_beta1 = mean(estimate)
  ) %>% ggplot(aes(x = mean_beta1, y = beta1)) + geom_point() +
  xlab(label = "Mean of Beta1 Hat") + 
  ylab(label = "True Value of Beta1 Estimate")
```

![](p8105_hw5_lef2147_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png)<!-- -->

The sample average of beta 1 hat across tests for which the null is
rejected is approximatley equal for beta1 = 0, but not for beta1 = 1.
This is because the standard error is so large. ?
